# ADR-001: Establish Monorepo and Initial Agents

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-09-21
**Repo:** `woodcreek-agents`

---

## Context

Managing a new home in the Woodcreek community involves HOA rules and processes (CC\&Rs, ACC requests, dues, amenities), city utilities (water/sewer, power, gas, internet, trash & recycling), household systems/vendors (HomePro central vacuum, AV/media room), **security prewires**, and **home warranties**. Much of this information is scattered across HOA packets, change orders, and vendor paperwork, making it easy to miss deadlines, violate rules unintentionally, or forget maintenance.

We will build a set of AI agents—an at‑home concierge—to unify this into proactive workflows: compliance alerts, permit/checklist help, reservations, vendor coordination, warranty claims, outage guidance, and system maintenance.

---

## Decision

Create a single monorepo named **`woodcreek-agents`** to host all agents, shared libraries, prompts, policies, tests, infra, and documentation. Ship an incremental MVP that automates high‑value, recurring tasks while remaining extensible for future devices/services.

---

## Initial Agent Set (MVP)

   * Finds availability and drafts requests for Amenity Center, pool party, outdoor kitchen, soccer field, and dog park access.
   * Reminds of pool hours, guest limits, and community events.

4. **Utilities Setup & Outage Agent**

   * One‑stop directory for water/sewer, electricity providers, gas, internet, trash/recycling/bulk pickup.
   * Guides outage reporting and tracks tickets.
   * Surfaces the right link/number per ZIP/provider.

5. **Home Maintenance & Landscaping Agent**

   * Creates incident logs, attaches photos, and escalates if needed.

8. **HOA Dues & Budget Agent**

   * Tracks semi‑annual assessments, payment reminders, receipts.
   * Projects upcoming HOA‑related expenses and reimbursables.

9. **HomePro Systems Agent (Central Vacuum + AV/Media Room)**

   * **Central Vacuum:** unit inventory, warranty tracker (lifetime on unit/piping/filter; 3‑year vacuum head)【58†source】, maintenance cadence, troubleshooting.
   * **Media Room/AV:** projector, screen, receiver, speakers, subwoofer, URC remote; calibration checklist, firmware reminders, upgrade planner (e.g., subwoofer).
   * Vendor liaison: contact details, quotes, scheduling.

10. **Perimeter Security & Cameras Agent**

    * Manages **IP‑CAM prewires** (installed during construction)【58†source】.
    * Provides bill of materials guidance (NVR, cameras, PoE, storage).
    * Monitors health: offline cameras, FPS drops, full storage.
    * Smart events: motion/vehicle/person detection after curfew, loitering, or abnormal quiet zones.
    * Privacy masks for sidewalks/neighbors.
    * Alerts Safety Agent for escalations.

    * Guides claims: intake workflow, photos, order #s, drafts for emails/calls, ticket tracking.
    * Links to Maintenance Agent (tasks required to preserve warranty).

---

## Non‑Goals (for MVP)

* Direct smart‑home device control (lights/locks/thermostats) beyond inventory/reminders.
* Financial planning/taxes beyond HOA dues and vendor invoices.
* Legal advice (agents provide citations/drafts, not binding counsel).

---

## Repo Structure

*(unchanged from prior draft; see existing ADR-001 content for tree layout)*

---

## Data Inputs & Sources (initial)

* **HOA Packet & CC\&Rs:** governing rules, forms, hours, contacts【57†source】.
* **City/Utilities:** water/sewer forms, REP comparison, outage numbers.
* **HomePro Docs & Change Orders:** central vac warranty, media room selections, **IP‑CAM prewire diagrams**【58†source】.
* **Receipts/Invoices:** builder options, HomePro packages, warranty terms.

---

## Consequences

* Centralized management of home tasks, compliance, warranties, and security.
* Reduced risk of HOA violations, missed dues, lapsed warranties, or unmonitored security.
* Extensible: future agents (insurance, smart devices, finance) can be added.

---

## Alternatives Considered

* Multi‑repo: rejected due to overhead.
* Third‑party HOA/utility apps only: rejected due to lack of extensibility.
